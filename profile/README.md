## Welcome to the Computational Physics Group @ GT CSE! 👋

* 🏫 We are located in the [CSE school](https://cse.gatech.edu) of the Georgia Tech College of Computing  
* 🙋 [Prof. Spencer Bryngelson](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/spencer-bryngelson) is the group PI, though the students do much of the work!  
* We solve problems in ❤️ health and ✈️ defense with **computational methods** and **big computers**
* 🌐 Our [group website](https://comp-physics.group) has more info. about the team and our research
* 🖥️ We write lots of code, feel free to dig in if you see something you like!  
* 🌊 We maintain [MFC](https://github.com/mflowcode), an exascale complex multiphase flow solver 
* We also work on [IMR](https://github.com/InertialMicrocavitationRheometry), a code for inferring material properties via cavitation 💥
* 👥 If you want to work with us, [check out this page!](https://comp-physics.group/vacancies.html)
